These are some items that I would like to improve upon in the future:
- The ability to edit my selections
- The ability to see a computed total price of my selections
- The ability to group duplicate selections (i.e. 2 Large Sodas)
- The ability to query for a dynamic menu (CORS Allow Access was not set on the server side, and so a static menu was set instead)
- Improve upon the mobile-friendliness of this app
- Improve upon the branding of this app (i.e. develop an original logo and color scheme)
- Add tests and comments
